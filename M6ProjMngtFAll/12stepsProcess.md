### Step 1 - Defining the Project
My project… Building an office shed in my garden.
- What is in scope/ out of scope?
- What are NOT going to have.
- What do you DEFINITELY want?
- Think about all stages and departments.
- Which expense in the scope.
- Talk to every stackholde
- Organise a  “Kick off meeting” with all the stakeholders.
- Agree on balancing the Three Circles.
  - **3-circles: Cost - Quality - Time**.
- Agree a budget with stakeholders.
- Decide a dead line.
- Identify your “key driver” (highest priority constraints).
- Decide your Key Driver now (before you’re emotional).
- Agree everything formally with your stakeholders.
- When does project begin

isnt quality or cost?   

Agree the 3-circles with the stackholder.

### Step 2 - Listing Tasks
a) Brainstorm about all the ideas and everything
b) Make a work breakdown structure
  - (Tree of tasks) > Divide all the tasks into categories 
  - Think about the project in categories and tasks
c) Ask experts
  - By definition, a project is something you’re never done before, so you might need expert input.
  - Using experts third respect their time.
d) Decide your “Granularity” (level of details)
  - aim for a ballpark of 20 to 30 tasks.
  - Go into detail on other separate lists and plans

> a. Brainstorm
> b. Work breakdown Structure, categories
> c. Talking to expert
> d. Planning, listing tasks ( 20 to 30 is good gauge)

### Step 3 - The Post It Notes
#### Post Its
- Write one task per note
- Use a diamond to signify an event. Eg Choose, Delivery.
- An event has no duration.
- Every task MUST have an arrow in and out.
- There can be multiple arrows per task.
- “Start activitie” have no dependency
- Put the tasks in order (without arrows)
- Arrange the tasks left to right in dependency order.
- Follow along with your practice project.
- Create a rough running order layout

#### Adding the Arrows
- Now add depency arrows
- Arrows show “denpendency” … i.e. you CAN’T do it until you’ve done the connected one(s).
- Put task as early as possible
- Change the order as you add the arrows
- Every task MUST have an arrow in and out.
- Consider what MUST be done before each task can start.
- Try to not cross your arrows
- This works best as a team activity.
- Add a “Finish” event for the final task arrows.

> post it notes arrange from left to right in the exact order and connect them ,
> multiple arrows per tasks,
> practise along the tasks
> change task during the process
> check budget

### Step 4 - Estimating Times
#### How Long is a Piece of String?
- Adding times to eask task.
- You must be honest and scientific
  - Don’t let one contaminate the other.
- Hours worked vs Elapsed Time.
- Use the elapsed time (i.e. when it will be given to you)
- Count time in weeks

> Learnt to use week instead of days, critical path is the important and slower path to study

#### Adding Times
- Every plan can be different
- But you must agree as a team and … stick to it
- This process works for any project, any size, any industry
- Tasks with no time are events.
- Do your estimates based on experience and experts

#### Critical Path
- Identify the Critical Path
- Look for the slowest possible chain of tasks.
- Draw the critical path in red.
- The Critical Path shows which tasks could made you finish late….
- … and tells you the total length of your project
- Removing tasks might move your Critical path.
- Planning means you set an achievable deadline.
- Invest time in planning your project.

> The critical path is the slowest possible chain of tasks, important to invest time to plan.
> Identify Critical Path - slowest/ longest time to complete the tasks.. which tells the total time needed to complete the project.

#### Wrap Up
- You can manage a project without being an expert in how to do it
- Always do post-it notes and THEN a Gantt Chart.
- Work along with your own project on the course.

> Good closure is very important. When planning is good everything will be on schedule

---
### Step 5 - Safety Margin & Check OK
#### Being 90% Reliable
- The safety margin must be on the Critical Path.
- Think about which tasks are high risk for delay.
- Add 50% of the worst case scenario.
- Statistically, 50% of te worst case gives 90% likelihood.
- Distribute the margin throughout the Critcal path.
- You’re not lying. You’re being more honest!

> Safety Margin must be placed at Critical Path & add 50% of worst-case & distribute them discreetly.

#### It Has to be Faster
- What is the customer can’t wait that long?
- Never cave and take out your safety margin.
  - To reduce time: Spend more, Reduce quality, Overlapping.
- The Critical Path is the only way to affect the overall time.
- Reducing quality means doing fewer tasks, or less well.
- Consider whether tasks can be overlapped.
- Overlapping usually results in higher risk

> work on the critical path. spend more, reduce quality or overlapping.

—--
### Step 6 - Gantt Chart
####  Setting Up Your Excel
- Type all your tasks into Column A
- Do the Critical Path tasks first.
- Include all Critical Path forks too.
- Add your ‘Finish’ event too.
- List your week numbers along the top.
- Hold down the Shift key to select. a whole group of columns.
- Select your cells, and then “Conditional Formatting”.
- Highlight cells greater than zero.

> name task in column A , key in all critical tasks, week numbers along the top , conditional format , select any cell greater than zero. i like this excel help

####  The Critical Path
- Fill in “1” for each week the task takes.
- Add a left hand border to create a line.
- The tasks gradually cascade in time order.
- Can add a diamond for extra clarity on events.
- A fork in the Critical Path looks like two parallel events.
- Maybe add a final finish line on delivery date

#### Learning Floating Tasks
- Now add the non Critical Path tasks (“Floating tasks”).
- What does it come after? What must it be done before?
- Add a border at the start and end of the flexibility window.
- Decide where you want to schedule the task.
- Best to allow some flexibility on the end
- Insert arrow shapes to show the float.

> Asked what comes after and what must be done before and then decide when to schedule the floating task.

#### Adding Other Floating Tasks
- These tasks are all floats.
- Their dependancy is on something which could move.
- “Critical” means slow, not important.
- If tasks get too complicated make them a sub project.

#### Making it Real
- A Gantt chart is a really useful visual representation of the plan.
- Add a row for the real dates of the project.
- Use formatting to make it vertical text.
- You can add in holidays and breaks too.
- Can also allocate names responsible.

> imput real dates make it more realistic and easier to adhere to the planned schedule
> place owners of the different tasks

#### Resource Planning 
- Plan where people’s time will be spent.
- Add in hours per week for each task.
- Can make separate sheets per person/dept.
- Add them up by week(vertical columns).
- Turn the totals into a resource strain graph.
- Sum up your total project hours, and hours per task.
- Floating tasks can be in any order.
- Assess whether the commitiments are achieveable
- Consider moving floating tasks for a lighter work load.

#### Gantt Chart for Costs
- Duplicate the whole sheet.
- Cross reference your budget page.

#### Budgeting
* WBS-Myman cave/office | My hours | my cost? | s/c cost | purchase $ | total 
  - Allocate costs to the time spent.
  - Consider outsourcing some tasks,
  - Access which tasks can’t be delegated.
  - Approve or edit the total spend v budget.
* Gantt Chart
  - Fill in costs per task per week
  - Assess the spread of expenses over time
  - Download your own template too

> Self-cost , purchase cost, sub-contractor cost, hours involved. Edit the budget accordingly, it makes sense to out-source some.

#### 3 Reasons I Love Gantt Charts
Always Follow This Exact Process
1. Gantt Charts are simple to build by following these steps.
2. It’s a good second check on:
  a. forgotten tasks
  b. realistic tasks
  c. time promised
  d. risks

1. Communication - with your team, boss, contractors, stackholders, other departments etc.
2. Resource Planning - moneey and time spread over busy/quiet weeks
3. Monitoring the progress - check today’s date against what is done

### Step 7 - Resources
#### Planning What You Need
- Make sure the hours required are realistic
- Note which tasks are waiting tasks, or outsourced.
- Can factor in non-working periods.
- Can add up the whole project to compare needs across all departments.
- Ensure you can handle all your different projects at the same time.

### Step 8 - Risk Analysis
#### What Can Go Wrong?
- After you’re made your Gantt, think “What could go wrong?”.
- The Critical Path is likely Time failure point.
- The Cost could be affected by any task.
- And just standard “Problems” risk!
- Try to think of as many issues as possible.
- Look at previous projects too.
- 1. How likely? 2. How serious?
- Think of ways to reduce the 1. Likelihood and/or 2.Severity
- Consider extra contengency if risks are hard to mitigate.
- Depending on your Key Driver allow extra time/money/scope reduction.

> what went wrong > money and time , look at critical time > need contingencies in terms of likely and seriousness

#### End of Planning, Start Implementation
- Next phase. … Implementation

### Step 9 - Monitoring Progress
#### Colouring in the Gantt
- Hold “shift” to duplicate edits across both tabs.
- Make a “Now line” (i.e. colour in the current week).
- Use the formatting paint brush to colour in completed tasks.
- Double click to select the brush long term.
- Colour everything you’ve done to track progress.
- Assess whether you can recover time easily later.
- Inform stakeholders of delays.
- Ideally you keep up with (or are ahead) of the “Now line”.

#### The Now Line
- Simply follow along each new week.
- Ensures no tasks get forgotten, even in busy periods.
- Aim to keep up with the Now Line.
- Can see (& fix) the ripple effects a long way in advance.
- Instant visual representation of progress.
- Make sure you get data, not stories.
- “Can I have a look at your Gantt chart?”

### Step 10 - Monitor Costs
#### Are You Over Budget?
- It can be easy, and expensive to overspend on projects.
- Follow along with the downloadable.
- WBS-My man cave / office | My hours | my cost? | s/c cost.
- Estimate out all your costs as accurately as possible.
- If it’s over budget you can decide whether to change the scope / plan.
- Can predict your spend profile per week.
- Don’t just match % time with % spend.
- Your spend profile may not be linear.
- The Gantt makes all these factors measurable!

> Cost easily overspend on projects. Monitoring and estimation the budget is a important area. If it's overspend you have to decide whether to change the scope or plan. Forecasting each spending. Don't just match % time with % spend. The Gantt chart make this measurable.

#### Forecasting Spend
- “Are we over spent?”
- “What will the total over spend be?”
- Being late can look like being under budget (without a Gantt).
- What does that mean for the final total?
- Was the issue a one off?
- Were my estimates ask too low?
- Are the problems going to carry on?
- Generally problems continue!
- Factor in more over spending in the future.

> overspent and amount overspent due to behind schedule
> if forecast wrongly, learn from the mistake and factor in more spending next time

### Step 11- Adjust Plan (if necessary)
#### Face the Music
- Dont’t feel bad! It’s not a failure.
- Come clean with your client and manage expectations.
- Revise the plan with an updated budget and time estimate.
- Choose which key drivers you’ll compromise on.
- Pay extra money to catch up the time.
- … or reduce quality to save time.
- Could you overlap tasks to regain time?
- Overlapping involves risk.
- Can we accept just finishing late?
- Adjust your Gantt chart to reflect the new plan.
- Do NOT just ignore it!
- Things are never cheaper/quicker than you expect!
- Get stakeholders to agree a plan to fix the second half.

> Revised and adjust plan if is necessary when is needed. When it is required we review progressed and adjust in order to finish the project at the lowest risks.

### Step 12 -  Review
#### What Can We Learn?
- Consider doing a Post Project Review.
  - Three ways:
    - Good, Bad and better;
    - Quality, Time, Cost; & 
    - finished Gantt chart.

Review_Template.pdf
```
	Project Review
	Project Description:
	Project Period (start & end date)
	GOOD
	What went well that others should repeat?
	BAD
	What mistakes were made? Or unexpected issues?
	BETTER
	What could be have been improved for future?
```
> Post project review is crucial , can look back the similar project and whats good, bad to avoid and what can be better. Quality , cost and time. Initial Gantt chart VS finishing Gantt chart > i like this
