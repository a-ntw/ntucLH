### A Deep Dive into Agile / 
#### What is Agile?
- If you are following Agile Manifesto frameworks you’re Agile!
- Agile is designed for adapting to change

It actually scrum extreme programming which are different frameworks that you use on an agile when you’re working in an agile product. Actually preceded the Agile Manifesto.

Developing a product that’s consistent with teh Agile Manifesto.

a list of four values.

agile puts less emphasis on planning and more emphasis on adapting to change.

#### Adapting to Changes
Waterfall
- Do you always need a finished plan?
- Do you know which task takes the longest?
- Will changes cause future regret?

Agile
- What is my #1 project priority?
- Make it useable as fast as possible
- Works best with flexible materials
- Get an insight of the whole picture very early.
- Continual iterations from client feedback

get together with your custome and you would decide which room to which room in your house is the most valuable you know.  
you’s use the most expensive most important feature first and then it’s complete.

Do the one most important thing first and then you can build on that from then on,

You can build off that iteratively and incrementally until you sort of build out a product.

Giving your customer a chance to give you feedback which is a ey part of Scrum and Agile mindset and then build off sort of and then not only get feedback but learn lessons as you’re building.

> Agile
> 1. Adapting to changes.
> 2. What is my #1 project priority (Which is the most valuable)
> 3, Make is useable as soon as possible
> 4. Work best with flexible material
> 5. Get an insight of the whole picture very early
> 6. Continual iteration from client feedback
> Great explanation. Now i get a clearer idea on agile

#### Which Projects Suit Agile vs Waterfall?
- Agile is best for products not projects
- Prefer to try and then improve instead of aim for perfection.
- Gives the client ultimate flexibility

agile teams don’t deliver projects.   

shouldn’t be afraid to throw away software if it’s suboptimal.   

software refactoring where you’re optimizing it all the time.

> Agile is better for products not projects. Agile good for software development. Perfect to try and improve instead of aim for perfection. Gives client ultimate flexibility.


#### The Dream Situation
- Ideally the customer is highly invloced and available.
- You might not want the customer closely involved.

EP teams to call it embracing change. Instead of saying OK, I don;t want to interact with my customer because they might change things and I’ve got a lot invested in this way that is, instead you’re like give me changes because I know that the more I change the more likely i get to meet you expectations.

> Ideally the customer is highly involve and available. Embrace change and please the customer. Is a great help in the progressing of work.

### Comparing Agile and WaterFall
#### Can Plans be TOO Flexible?
- Waterfall shows you the effect of any changes
- Waterfall changes are over a long time % large budget
- Have to keep to micro deliveries 
-  The customer canchange the budget/ deadline/ spec any time

A Time box in scrum in that you deliver what you promised every two weeks overtime.

> 1. Agile embrace change and please the customer
> 2. Waterfall show you the effect of any changes and is very flexible
> 3. Waterfall changes are over a long time and large budget
> 4. Agile customer can change the budget / deadline / spec anytime
> 5. Agile every matric is lock in a time box in scrum. You deliver what you promise every two weeks.

#### Estimating Cost
- Gives ultimate flexibility to the customer
- What is the true time investment on a project?
- The work is continuous and intense
- Is there enough time for creativity?

scrum always says that of you want to have sort of creativity or something like that the best thing to do is think smaller.

You can’t sort of you have your creativity you have your delivery comne at the expense of your creativity.

#### It All Comes Together at te End
- WaterFall, choose how often you want deliverables.
- Scrum, Phases are check-in, Sprints are completion deadlines.
- Scrum, Have a useable product at every point

> 1. Waterfall can chose how often you want deliverables
> 2. Waterfall deliver in phase
> 3. Phases are check-in. Sprints are completion deadlines
> 4. Agile can have useable product at every point

#### Is Agile Only for Software?
- Waterfall, Is there always an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) option?
- Waterfall: Is Agile only suitable for software?
- Agile is best suited to digital products 
- Focus on what is valuable about it
- In Waterfall we think about goals at the start

if you were going to use an agile aprroach then you’re focused on the value.

> Agile is best suited to digital products.
> Agile focus what's valuable
> Waterfall define the project first. Then think of goals and start
> Agile scrum talk about what a project want

#### What About for Unfamiliar Projects?
- Waterfall: Which is better if you’ve never dont it before?
- If you know your requirements you don’t need Agile
- Waterfall: How do you plan the sprints?
- There is no planned ending to Agile projects
- Everything you deliver is potentially ship-able
- Enables midway drastic privots
- Waterfall: What about projects that need just a bit of flexibility?
- Waterfall is better if you want to be hands off/delegate

Scrum teams are predictable but not planned, which means that the customer knows that every two weeks they’re going to get sonthing new, and it’s going to be valuable to them.

> Requirements mean specifications for the project :)
> If you have clear specifications you should use Waterfall because it won't require constant feedback.

> the phrase is: "If you know your requirement, you don't need Agile".

#### Does Agile Cost More?
- Waterfall: How can it be efficient without a critical path?
- Agile doesn’t really accomodate dependencies
- Dependencies between teams are a problem in Agile
- Agile gets rid of dependencies between teams by using multi-functional teams
- Waterfall copes easily with specialists
- Agile requires cross-functional team members

Clearly the cost element here is the feedback.

each peson will have knid of there’ll be a generalized expert.

> Agile doesn't really accomadate dependencies. Dependencies between are teams are a problem for agile. Agile gets rid off dependencies between teams by using muti- functional teams. Waterfall copes easily with specialists. So much i have learnt and gain a lot of new knowledge.

#### Can Agile Handle Big Projects?
- Organisational structures don’t suit scaled Agile
- Best to break down into small flexible Agile teams

> Waterfall is good for big projects in order to control cost, time and quality of product delivery. Big projects is a challenge when using Agile. Organisational structures don't suit scale Agile. Best to breakdown into smaller flexible Agile teams.

#### Fitting into Larger Projects
- Can use a hybrid model for small innovations

#### The Secret Gantt Chart Behind Agile
- Agile teams could never make a Gantt chart
- The work is not a linear continuum 
- Agile is best for products not projects
- Agile suits science applications & Waterfall for manufacturing
- Waterfall: Is Agile best for ongoing creative projects?
- In Agile the time and cost are undecided

typical scrum teams use a burn down chart is because you’re burning down the work until have nothing left.

Almost all agile producs almost all the products they work on with a team with an agile mindset has a vert set cost. And so it’s how many features can you get for that cost exactly.

> Gantt Chart suitable in construction, manufacturing. Agile - building product - modular form - flexibility to adapt and change.

#### How Many Deliverablres Can You Have?
- If you know EXACTLY what you want, Waterfall is better
- Agile deals with chaos very smoothly
- Manufacturing teams working together can be highly effective

Toyota Production System, started lean software development.

> Waterfall is better if you know what exactly what you want. Agile deals with chaos very smoothly.

#### How does Kanban fit with Agile?
- Waterfall: Does Agile encorporate Kanban?
- Kanban invloves deliberating limiting production flow
- Software can benefit from Kanban in some situations 
- The task board shows progress & deadlines visually
- Product backlog shows which is the current top priority 

> kanban is a measurement to the work flow

> KanBan involves deliberately limiting production flow. In software KanBan is a way to maintain a sustainable pace when you have work going through a systems. Software can benefit from KanbBan in some situations at doing operation systems. The tasks board in scum shows progress and deadlines visually. KanBan board show priority of work. It really make sense if we understand the differences.

#### What Is the Point of Burn Down Charts?
- Waterfall: Are Burn Down Charts just a budget?
- Set your timeline based on number os sprints

showing how many tasks are being burned down to the bottom, will be the sprint review..

relaese burn down which is a little more sophisticated.

> In scrum burn down chart shows the burn down of tasks to be meet the sprints to be review. Released burn down chart set your timeline based on number of sprints. Untill the products indentify and released.

#### Can Sprints be More/Less than 2 Weeks?
- Waterfall: Can Sprints be a length other than two weeks?
- Keep breaking down into the true value source 

### Which to Choose?

#### Which is Better for the Customer?
- Waterfall: Which method is better fir the customer?
- Waterfall; Do customers want flexibility or certainty?
- Have much more regular accountability

> Waterfall show more certainty in delivery a project at each phase. Waterfall copes easily with specialists. Waterfall is good for big projects in order to control cost, time and quality of product delivery. Waterfall is better if you know what exactly what you want
> Agile embrace change and please the customer. Agile customer can change the budget / deadline / spec anytime. Agile deliver in sprints. Everything deliver in scrum is potentially ship-able.
> It depend on the projects or products to fit in. Both are great methods.

#### Planning for a Hurricane
- Cone of Uncertainty supposedly leads to more clarity as time passes
- Waterfall: Does a lack of forward planning cause regret?
- If the specification is unknot or highly variable
- Effort is so often wasted because of the unknown
- With Agile you get deliverables as you go along
- You are always relying on imperfect information
- Waterfall: With Agile you have ti trsut the Gantt
- Balance the cost of planning and the certainty it will add
- Does your Project require experimenting?
- Do you want to see interrim deliverables?
- Do you want to leave subcontractors to do it?

> Balance the cost of planning and the certainty it will add. Idea of interim deliverables is a great. But it will all depends on the project or product we are looking at.

#### When to Use Agile vs Waterfall
- Waterfall: Can both work for some occasions?
- Waterfall is best if the customer knows their spec
- Can Waterfall ever br better for tech?
- Agile is great for tasks needing a scientific approach 

> Waterfall works best for fixed budgets and timeline. Although, Agile can be a good option when you can't have clear specifications of the product :)

#### Can You Ever Merge Both?
- Not recommended to mix both
- Waterfall requires more trust in the end result working

> Agile gives/show consistency since there are deliverable fortnightly, waterfall may not as it requires more trust in the people doing the tasks because they might do very little in the 1st week and cram all work to the last for whatever reason.

#### Reducing Documentation 
- Waterfall doesn’t need as much paperwork as people think
- Waterfall: What is the Agile documentation load?
- Agile: Documents are ranked by value added
- Tries to reduce paperwork to meet sprints
- Agile encourages a lot of communication (ideally face to face)
- Avoid detail entirely until you get there

> Waterfall could be done on excel and is much more easier. Waterfall style is design to minimize communications. It create a perfect required document so no one will come back to you. Agile documents are rank by value added. Agile product can be a document too. Scrum try keep a low value of documentation to meet sprints. Agile encourage a lot of communications and ideally face to face.

### Wrap Up
#### The Future of Agile?
- Is Agile too open office & San Fran based?
- The scaling isn’t perfected quite yet

> Agile: Interactive and manage projects. No truth Agile practitioners... Scaling not the right, Agile more suitable for scientific... complicated and exploring products
