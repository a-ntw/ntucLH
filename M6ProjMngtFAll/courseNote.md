### Reasons for starting a project:
* Market Demand
* Strategic opportunities
* Customer request
* Technological advancement
* Legal requirements

### Case study
* Portfolio:
* Collection of Programs:
* Projects:
P* roduct:

### Operations:
* On-going
* Repetitive
* Business sustenance

### Why formal Project management is needed?
* Better control
* Customer relationship improvement
* Improved productivity
* Better team moral
* Lower cost
* Higher reliability/ quality

### Choosing the roght methodology 
Based on “WHAT” and “HOW” to be produced
* Option 1
  * Know what needs to be done and how it is going to be done
  * *Scope is clear amd technology is clear* > Waterfall
* Option 2
  * Knows what needs to be done but don’t know how to do it (or)  Knows how to do it but don’t know what needs to be done
  * *Eiter scope or technology is clear* > Agile method 
* Option 3
  * Dob’t know how to do and don’t know what to do.
  * *Both the scope and technology is not clear* > 

### Option 1
* Traditional approached like
  * Project Management Institute’s PMBOK
  * AXELO’s PRINCE 2
  * Water fall methodology
  * Stage gate methodology
  * etc

### Option 2
* Agile approached like
  * Scrum
  * XP (Extreme Programming)
  * DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method)
  * Kanban
  * Crystal
  * FDD
  * etc

### Option 3
* Complex project management
* Empathy map
* Journey maps
* Story maps
* etc

### Option 1
PMI - Management Institute (R)
* Based in Pennsylvania 
* Started in 1969
* Provides the de-facto standards for Project management
* Split into four qualification levels
* CAPM (Certified Associate in Project Management)
* PMP (Project Management Professional)
* PgMP (Program Management Professional)
* PfMP (Portfolio Management Professional)

PMI
Monitoring and Controlling 

initiation > Planning / Execution > Closing

### Option 1
PMI
* Is based on PMBOK, which is a standard and not a methodology
* Driving factor is customer requirements
* It is industry neutral
* Mainly focusses on the “HOW?”part of the project management
* It is activity based

### Option 1
PRINCE 2 (r) - Axelos
* PRojects IN Controlled Environment
* UK based methodology
* Split into two qualification levels
* Foundation
* Practitioner

PRINCE 2
* Is a methodology
* Clearly defined process model and templates
* More IT focused
* Driving factor is business case
* PM acts as a middleman between project and control board
* Primarly answers “WHAT?”part of project management
* It is deliiverable based

#### Waterfall
Waterfall for Agile
> Requirements
> Analysis
> Design
> Coding
> Testing

#### Spiral
1. Objectives determination and identify alternative solutions
2. Identify and resolve risks
3. Develop next version of the product
4. Review and plan for the next phase 

Spiral
* Project is large scaled
* Involved high-risk projects
* Requirements are unclear
* Possibility of changes are high
* Cost and risk evaluation

### Option 2
Agile
#### Cycles  
> Iterate > Plan > Design  > Execute >  Feedback

*******************************
#### **Agile Values**
* Individuals and interactions OVER processes amd tools
* Working software OVER comprehensive documentation
* Customer collaboration OVER contract negotiation
* Responding change OVER following a plan

*******************************

#### Agile Principles (1–6 of 12)
* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
* Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
* Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
* The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
#### Agile Principles (7-12 of 12)
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.
* Agile process promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
* Continuous attention to technical  excellence and good design enhances agility.
* Simplicity —the act of maximizing the amount of work not done —is essential.
* The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
* At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.

## Option 2
### Kanban 
Backlog | Queue | Work in Process | Done

* Simple and clear
* Visual representation of what need to be worked on
* Prioritization is easy

### DevOps
* Dev - package > verify > create > plan >
* Ops - Release > Configure > Monitor >

* Faster
* Better
* Cheaper
* Collaboration between Dec and Ops team

#### Phases common to all these framework / methodology* 
* Initiating 
* Planning
* Execution
* ???

### Stakeholders
Project Manager - Team, End users, Account managers, Project leads, Operational team, Project management office, Sponsor, Managers, Client. 

PMI.prg
* Stakeholder interests need to go together over time.
* We need a philosophy of volunteerism - to engage stakegolders and manage relationship ourselves rather than leave it to government.
* We need to find solutions to issues that satisfy multiple stakeholders simultaneously.
* Everything that we do serves stakeholders. We never trade off the interests of one versus the other continuously over time.
* We act with purpose that fulfills our commitment to stakeholders. We act with aspiration towards fulfilling our dreams and theirs.
* We need intensive communication and dialogue with stakeholders - not just those who are friendly.
* Stakeholders consist of real people with names and faces and children, They are complex.
* We need to generalize the markerting approach.
* We engare with both primary and secondary stakeholders
* We constantly monitor and redesign processes to make them better serve our stackholders. Because stakeholder involvement is critical for the success of a project, where projects without active participation from stakeholders are prone to failure, stakeholder management should be topic that evey agile team knows well.

### Responsibility Assignment Matrix
* Responsible
* Accountable
* Consult
* Informed

### Project Inititation document (OID)

* Three primary use
  * Ensure the stability of the project before the board can make any major commitment
  * Base document for progess tracking, issue tracking and evaluating ongoing viability
  * Single source of reference. Gives clarity about the project and how it is being managed 

### Contents of PID
1. Project definition - Expectation from the project (background, scope and exclusions, constraints and assumption etc)
2. Project approach - Choice of solution
3. Business case - (Discussed earlier)
4. Organization chart - Organizational description
5. Role description  - Responsibility assignment matrix
6. Quality management strategy - Quality standards and quality techniques
