## Course outline
The course outline is as follows:

[Module 1. Overview of HTML and CSS](/ntuc03html/ntuc03html_mod01.md)

This module provides an overview of HTML and CSS. Much of the material on HTML will be a review, but it ensures that all the students are up to speed and understand the terminology used throughout the course.

[Module 2. Creating and Styling HTML Pages](/ntuc03html/ntuc03html_mod02.md)

This module covers the new features in HTML5 and CSS3. It describes the new HTML5 elements, such as using the `<nav>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` tags to add semantic structure to an HTML document. It also covers markup for images and for text elements, such as `<hgroup>`, `<time>`, `<mark>`, `<small>`, `<figure>`, and `<figcaption>`.

[Module 3. Introduction to JavaScript](/ntuc03html/ntuc03html_mod03.md)

This module describes how to use JavaScript to add dynamic functionality to a webpage.

[Module 4. Creating Forms to Collect and Validate User Input](ntuc03html/ntuc03html_mod04.md)

This module covers the new forms input features provided by HTML5.

[Module 5. Communicating with a Remote Server](/ntuc03html/ntuc03html_mod05.md)

This module covers the creation of webpages that can communicate with web services.

[Module 6. Styling HTML5 by Using CSS3](/ntuc03html/ntuc03html_mod06.md)

This module goes into more detail on using CSS to style text and graphics.

[Module 7. Creating Objects and Methods by Using JavaScript](/ntuc03html/ntuc03html_mod07.md)

This module provides more information on JavaScript, concentrating on techniques and best practices for writing well-structured, maintainable code.

[Module 8. Creating Interactive Pages by Using HTML5 APIs](/ntuc03html/ntuc03html_mod08.md)

This module shows some of the new features that have been added to HTML5 to enable webpages to interact with the user and with the operating system running the browser.

[Module 9. Adding Offline Support to Web Applications](/ntuc03html/ntuc03html_mod09.md)

This module describes how to enable a web application to support offline operations.

[Module 10. Implementing an Adaptive User Interface](/ntuc03html/ntuc03html_mod10.md)

This module describes how to use CSS styles to implement an adaptive user interface that can detect the form factor of the device running the browser, and to modify the layout of the content accordingly.

[Module 11. Creating Advanced Graphics](/ntuc03html/ntuc03html_mod11.md)
