 can I say String being immutable means: 
when u try to update the value of a String object, the old String object becomes unreferenced and a new String object is created and referenced to instead?

 In computer science, pseudocode is a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or another system. Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of a normal programming language, but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading

Google: String pool

Stack:
	static/class variables - will init
	instant/field variables - will init

	local variable - developers responsibility

Heap:
	new instances();


String str = “Welcome”; // Stack // variable favour
String str1 = “Welcome”; // Stack

String str2= new String(“Welcome”); // Heap // object favour

// Java 7


```
static int i;
int j;

public static void main(String args()) {

// Strings are STILL immutable

int k = 10;

//String Variables
String str1 = ”Welcome”;
String str2 = ”Welcome”;
String str3 = ”welcome”;


String str3 =  new String(”Welcome”); //  String object


System.out.println(“ i :  ” + i);
System.out.println(“ j :  ” + new Test1().j);
System.out.println(“ k :  ” + k);
