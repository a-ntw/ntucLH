 hello folks, if you find typing the jar command line a little tedious, you can put that line in a text file. For example, i created a text file called dnT.txt. This text file contained the line of text within the double quotes " -cvfm dnT.jar META-INF\MANIFEST.MF com\oop\dnT.class" Then on the command line, i type jar  @dnT.txt

Describe how the objects interact with one another.
Define the external behavior of the objects.
Define the internal behavior of the objects.

### abstract. 

public abstract class Animal ( // Abstract

From Chandra Sekhar to Everyone: (3:24 PM)
 Why Abstract 			== Security Feature [copyright]
============			== Ensure a particular funcationality is implement by all Children

	1) if you don't want a particular class to be instantiated
	2) When it doesn't make sense to implement a method 
	
	Animal an = new Animal(); // cow, cat, dog......
	Car c = new Car(); // Nissan, .... 



Rules about abstract class 
==========================

A class with Abstract Methods should always be Abstract

A abstract class can never be instantiated 

A abstract class can have 0/more Abstract methods or 0/more non-abstract methods

A child class which extends abstract class should implement
all abstract methods inherited or should be declared abstract itself

## Interface
From Chandra Sekhar to Everyone: (4:28 PM)
 Interface can be implemented by a Class


all methods in an Interface are abstract i.e. no body / no implementation 
all variables are public and final

any class that implements the interface should implement the methods or become ABSTRACT 

From Ren Jie Wong to Everyone: (4:28 PM)
 is this right?

in interfaces, there isn't a need to use abstract keyword on the abstract methods (bcos all of interface mthods are abstract), but in abstract classes, we have to cause there a mix of implemented and abstracted methods.
