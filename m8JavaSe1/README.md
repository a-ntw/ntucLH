### UML use case diagram
201103
#### Online banking application has two primary operations:
1. Manage accounts that consist of submodules "opening account" and "transfer funds".
2. Generate history transaction report that consist of "monthly transaction report by accounts" and "monthly transaction reports by date".

Two groups will use the applications:
1. Bank's customer who will be responsible for "manage account" and "generate history transaction"
2. Bank's teller who is responsible for "manage account"

With the above scenario, create uml (Unified Modelling Language) use case diagram, that show relationship both groups and application.â€©

### java project application
201104
#### Create a java project application with following specifications:
1. create java application name Customer.java
2. in the Customer.java, create the following variables:
   - name of type String
   - address of type String with a default value of "-Singapore-"
   - gender of type char
   - age of type int with default value of 0
3. In the Customer.java, create a method name "printCustomerInf" 
   that displays the value of "name", "address", "gender" and "age"
4. create a unit test / main class java application name "CustomerTest.java"
5. In the "CustomerTest.java", instantiate the Customer class and 
    call the method "printCustomerInf".
6. Compile and run the CustomerTest application.
7. Place breakpoint at where you instantiate the Customer object
8. Show the variables of Customer objec

### Console Application
201105
#### Create a console application with following specification:  
1. Create a java application name InputFromConsole.java
2. Prompt user to input 2 words. Input "Hello" and "thankyou"
3. Obtain the entered string and get the total length of 2 words.
4. Display the inputs and length of each word and the total length of 2 words.
5. Compile and run the application.
