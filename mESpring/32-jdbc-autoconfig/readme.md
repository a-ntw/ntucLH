Spring Boot Starters, Auto-configuration and Runtime
---

### Purpose
In this lab you will go a level deeper into core Spring Boot concepts while "Bootifying" a previous version of the Rewards application.

### Learning Outcomes
What you will learn about Spring Boot:

Dependency Management

Auto-configuration

Packaging & Runtime

Spring Boot Testing

Specific subjects you will gain experience with:

Spring Boot Starter Bill-of-Materials (BOMs)

Datasource Auto-configuration

Application deployment artifact packaging

Simple application runtime with CommandLineRunner

Simple SpringBootTest

You will be using the 32-jdbc-autoconfig project.

Estimated time to complete: 45 minutes.

### Use Case
Take a Spring application using JDBC and convert it to a Spring Boot application.

The application builds the data access layer using a Datasource and a JdbcTemplate. JDBC implementations of the AccountRepository, CustomerRepository and RewardRepository have been implemented for you.

You will alter that application in three ways:

Bootify the application, meaning you will wrap the application with Spring Boot, and demonstrate how Spring Boot simplifies your development experience through starters and auto-configuration.

Bootify the application's integration test.

Add a CommandLineRunner to demonstrate how Spring Boot can package and run an application with no additional runtime dependencies.

Demonstrate how to exclude an auto-configuration.

Demonstrate external configuration.

### Getting Started
You will start with the 32-jdbc-autoconfig project.

You will also need a Terminal or Command window to run Maven or Gradle manually - IntelliJ/Eclipse/STS support a terminal window within the IDE.

Navigate to the parent directory containing the course projects (this is the lab directory of the code you cloned/unzipped from github).

### Quick Instructions
If you are already knowledgeable with the lesson concepts, you may consider jumping right to the code, and execute the lab in the form of embedded TODO comments. Instructions on how to view them are here.

If you arenâ€™t sure, try the TODO instructions first and refer to the lab instructions by TODO number if you need more help.

### Instructions
#### Review of a Spring App - Dependencies
* Navigate to the project, and run the full suite of tests to verify the build is successful and tests pass.

* Examine the pom.xml or build.gradle file of the project. What do you see for the project dependencies?

    * You should see a set of libraries covering Spring Framework, JDBC and HSQLDB database
    * You should also see a set of libraries for Testing
### Bootify your Spring App
In this section we will wrap our app with Spring Boot.

#### Refactor to Starters
Part of the value point of Spring Boot is simplified dependency management. In this section, you will refactor from discrete Spring Framework and 3rd party dependencies to the Spring Boot Starters.

* In your Terminal/Command window, run Maven goal or Gradle task for displaying dependencies. (The example commands below assume you are running them at the lab directory.)
``` console
Windows: mvnw -pl *-common -pl *jdbc-autoconfig dependency:tree -Dincludes=org.springframework
Linux/MacOS: ./mvnw -pl *-common -pl *jdbc-autoconfig dependency:tree -Dincludes=org.springframework
```
``` console
Windows: gradlew :32-jdbc-autoconfig:dependencies --configuration compileClasspath -Dincludes=org.springframework
Linux:MacOS: ./gradlew :32-jdbc-autoconfig:dependencies --configuration compileClasspath -Dincludes=org.springframework
```
* What dependencies do you see for the jdbc-autoconfig project?
    * You should see dependencies for Spring JDBC and Spring Test and all their transitive dependencies.
    * You will also see the spring-boot-starter as this is required for SpringApplication.run() whether you use the rest of Spring Boot or not.
#### TODO-01 : Add Spring Boot Plugin:

* Add the Spring Boot plugin to the project's pom.xml or build.gradle file
``` java
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```
```
apply plugin: "org.springframework.boot"
```
What does the Spring Boot plugin do for you?

You will see, as we build the project, Spring Boot plugin will generate the runtime deployment artifact for you through the repackage goal for Maven and the bootJar task for Gradle. The repackage goal is run as part of the Maven package goal and the bootJar task is run as part of Gradle assemble task.

You will see this in action later in this lab.

#### TODO-02 : Refactor to Spring Boot Starters:

Remove the Spring JDBC and Spring Test dependencies from the project's pom.xml or build.gradle file.

Add the Spring Boot Starters for:

    * JDBC
    * Testing (only for Maven)
Hint: If you need help to understand the starter dependencies, take a look at the Spring Boot Intro lab pom.xml or build.gradle that was generated by the Spring Initializr.

* Rerun the maven dependency:tree Maven goal or dependencies Gradle task for the project:

* What dependencies do you see now?
    * You should now see the Boot starter dependencies instead.

Typically your Spring Boot pom.xml or build.gradle file is simpler than the original but this example is sufficiently simple that there is little difference.

### Create a Spring Boot Application
Start with creation of the Spring Boot application:

#### TODO-03 : Turn the RewardsApplication into a Spring Boot application:

You already have a RewardsApplication class provided for you. This is the shell for the Spring Boot application.

Annotate the RewardsApplication class accordingly.

What exactly does the annotation do?

> Hint: In your IDE, look at a decompiled version of the @SpringBootApplication annotation. (Or look at the Javadoc of the annotation.)

Notice that a main() method has already been defined and the Spring boot classes initialized using SpringApplication.run

#### TODO-04 : Let Spring Boot execute database scripts

Move the schema.sql and data.sql files in the src/test/resources/rewards.testdb directory to the src/main/resources/ directory.

Why are you doing this?

* You are refactoring the directory structure to the default that Spring Boot expects for its life-cycle initialization - specifically for automatic database initialization.

In the non-Spring Boot version, the EmbeddedDatabaseBuilder in SystemTestConfig can specify where the SQL initialization files are found.

In Spring Boot applications, the default files are schema.sql and data.sql and they must be in the classpath root.

> Note: You may choose to specify these files using properties (as described in the slides).

* The starting point of the project does not have a runner, so the files originally were provided to set up a test data fixture.

You are moving the files from test/resources to main/resources so you can use the same files in the application runtime to demonstrate the CommandLineRunner.

#### TODO-05 : Setup a command line runner to print the Reward account count:

Implement a CommandLineRunner in your RewardsApplication class. Remember it must be configured as a Spring bean.

Add code to use a JdbcTemplate to query the number of accounts using SQL query string already declared in the class. Request the result as a Long and assign it to numberOfAccounts. Remember Spring Boot will auto-configure a JdbcTemplate bean for you automatically.

Use the provided logger to log the returned number of accounts at info level- something like following:
```
logger.info("Number of accounts: {}" , numberOfAccounts);
```
The Spring Boot CommandLineRunner and ApplicationRunner abstractions are guaranteed to run at most once before SpringApplication.run() method returns. Multiple runners may be configured, and can be ordered with the @Order annotation.

### Capture properties into a class
#### TODO-06 : Use @ConfigurationProperties to capture properties

Spring Boot @ConfigurationProperties allows developer to map properties, especially properties with hierarchical structure, into a class.

Note that application.properties file already contains the following properties
``` console
rewards.recipient.name=John Doe
rewards.recipient.age=10
rewards.recipient.gender=Male
rewards.recipient.hobby=Tennis
```
Annotate RewardsRecipientProperties class with @ConfigurationProperties with prefix attribute set to rewards.recipient

Create fields (along with needed getters/setters) that reflect the properties above in the RewardsRecipientProperties class
``` java
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "rewards.recipient")
public class RewardsRecipientProperties {

    private String name;
    private int age;
    private String gender;
    private String hobby;

    // getter and setter methods

}
```
Now use one of the 3 schemes below to enable @ConfigurationProperties (Feel free to try all of them.)

Add @EnableConfigurationProperties(RewardsRecipientProperties.class) to RewardsApplication class

Add @ConfigurationPropertiesScan to RewardsApplication class (This is supported from Spring Boot 2.2.1)

Annotate the RewardsRecipientProperties class with @Component

Implement a new command line runner that displays the name of the rewards recipient
``` java
@Bean
CommandLineRunner commandLineRunner2(RewardsRecipientProperties rewardsRecipientProperties) {
    return args -> System.out.println("Recipient: " + rewardsRecipientProperties.getName());
}
```
### Run your Spring Boot Application
#### TODO-07 (Optional) : In your IDE, run the application:

Add debug=true property to your application.properties. This causes Spring Boot to log everything it does and what auto-configuration choices it does and does not make.

Run the application. What do you see on the console?

You should see your log output from the command line runner:
``` console
INFO : rewards.RewardsApplication - Number of accounts:21
```
You should also see an Auto-Configuration Report, that is prefixed as follows:
``` console
============================
CONDITIONS EVALUATION REPORT
============================

Positive matches:
-----------------
```
Do you see DataSourceAutoConfiguration under Positive matches? Now you know where the DataSource came from.

Do you also see JdbcTemplateAutoConfiguration under Positive matches?

### Bootify your Integration Test
#### TODO-08 : Disable explicit DataSource creation in SystemTestConfig:

Open SystemTestConfig.java.

Stop Spring invoking the dataSource() bean factory method by commenting out the @Bean annotation.

#### TODO-09 : Return to your IDE and refactor RewardNetworkTests into a Spring Boot Integration test:

Run this test without making any change, it will fail. It fails because the Spring Boot auto-configuration is not enabled when the test is run.

Remove the @ContextConfiguration and @ContextConfiguration(classes = {SystemTestConfig.class}) annotations.

Add @SpringBootTest annotation to run as a Spring Boot Test

* There is no need to specify the configuration class to use as the annotation will automatically component scan for any @Component (or @Configuration) classes in the current package or below. Since the SystemTestConfig class is in the same package, it will be discovered and processed. This includes processing the @Import annotation that references the RewardsConfig class containing all the other bean definitions.

* This is considered an End-To-End integration test, including the wired components.

Note that in a real production application you are most likely to configure an external database. Spring Boot offers properties to do this.

Run the RewardNetworkTests and verify it succeeds.

Do an experimentation

* Specify the configuration class with @SpringBootTest like following:
``` console
@SpringBootTest(classes={SystemTestConfig.class})
```
* Run the test and observe that it fails. Think about why it fails.

The failure occurs because Spring Boot autoconfiguration is disabled: when you specify the configuration class, @SpringBootTest stops searching for configuration class annotated with @SpringBootConfiguration, which contains @EnableAutoConfiguration.

* Revert the change and verify the test succeeds again

You will dig deeper into Spring Boot Testing in a later unit.

### Override Auto-Configuration
You have seen to this point that Spring Boot will detect and automatically configure a DataSource on your behalf. But how would this work if you needed to configure multiple databases from your application? In this case auto-configuration cannot really help you.

You have two options to handle this situation:

Use the default DataSource auto-configuration with supporting default configuration, and also explicitly set additional DataSource beans with different names, as specified by the @Qualifier annotation. You can also set the order of precedence using the @Order annotation.

Disable auto-configuration for DataSource, and explicitly declare multiple DataSource beans using Java Configuration.

We will use option 2 and disable the DataSource auto-configuration both programmatically and using configuration properties.

### Disable DataSource Auto-Configuration Programmatically
Do the following steps if you have extra time.

#### TODO-10 (Optional) : Switch to explicit DataSource configuration:

Add DataSource bean explicitly in the RewardsConfig class by by uncommenting the code.

  * Note the debug log message, so we can tell if this method is being used.

Remove the code that injects DataSource bean since we no longer needs it.

Fix any compile errors in the RewardsConfig class.

Notice this reverts to the standard Spring way of building a DataSource.

#### TODO-11 (Optional) : Disable DataSource auto-configuration:

Annotate the @SpringBootApplication to exclude the DataSource auto-configuration - @SpringBootApplication has an exclude attribute.

* The bean to exclude is DataSourceAutoConfiguration class you were told to remember earlier

Import the RewardsConfig configuration

* This is required since the RewardsConfig configuration now provides DataSource bean and will not be auto-detected through component scanning

Note: Technically you don't have to disable data-source auto-configuration given that Spring Boot will use application defined DataSource bean over auto-configured one.
#### TODO-12 (Optional) : Turn on debug level logging and rerun:

In your src/main/resources/application.properties configuration modify the logging.level.config property to DEBUG.

Run the 'RewardNetworkTests' test.

* Do you see your dataSource creation debug log output?

If so you just proved your dataSource was generated in your Java config.

* Do you see the DataSourceAutoConfiguration is no longer matched?

Look for the following console output:
``` console
Exclusions:
-----------

org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.jdbc.DataSourceAutoConfiguration
```
> Trouble-shooting: If you experience BeanCurrentlyInCreationException, think about why that is the case and how to solve it.

> Notes for Thought: When you Bootified your application, did you auto-wire a JdbcTemplate? If you did, what might be some implications for a multi-database solution? Would you need to remove use of an auto-wired JdbcTemplate? How would you do this?
### Build and Run using Command Line tools - Optional
Do this part of the lab only if you have extra time.

#### TODO-13 (Optional) : Let's see what the Spring Boot Maven/Gradle plugin is doing:

From either your IDE or your Terminal/Command window, execute the Maven package goal or Gradle assemble task.

The following leverages the parent project multi-module build with the maven/gradle wrapper, and is executed from the project root lab directory.

Notice that, when using Maven, it is necessary to skip the tests using the -Dmaven.test.skip=true flag due to the fact that you have not yet Bootified the testing portion of the project.
``` console
Windows: mvnw clean package -pl *common -pl *jdbc-autoconfig -Dmaven.test.skip=true
Linux/MacOS: ./mvnw clean package -pl *common -pl *jdbc-autoconfig -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```
``` console
Windows: gradlew :32-jdbc-autoconfig:clean :32-jdbc-autoconfig:assemble
Linux/MacOS: ./gradlew :32-jdbc-autoconfig:clean :32-jdbc-autoconfig:assemble
```
In 32-jdbc-autoconfig, a target directory (for Maven), or a build/libs directory (for Gradle) should now exist. Review its contents, what do you see?

* You should see two generated JAR files:

    * 32-jdbc-autoconfig-5.0.c.RELEASE.jar and
    * 32-jdbc-autoconfig-5.0.c.RELEASE.jar.original (for Maven)
    * 32-jdbc-autoconfig-5.0.c.RELEASE-original.jar (for Gradle)

Notice that the "original" is much smaller. The other JAR is executable and contains all the necessary dependencies (hence it is called a "fat" JAR!)

Extract the jar file to a temporary directory, and view the contents using jar.

Windows:
``` console
mkdir temp
copy *jdbc-autoconfig\target\*RELEASE.jar temp (for Maven)
copy *jdbc-autoconfig\build\libs\*RELEASE.jar temp (for Gradle)
cd temp
jar xvf *.jar
```
Linux or MacOS:
``` console
mkdir temp
cp *jdbc-autoconfig/target/*RELEASE.jar temp (for Maven)
cp *jdbc-autoconfig/build/libs/*RELEASE.jar temp (for Gradle)
cd temp
jar xvf *.jar
```
What do you see?

You will see the classpath resources, manifest file and supporting compile scope package classes are included.

* Look carefully at the BOOT-INF directory.
    * What do you see?
    * What do its subdirectories contain?

* Look in the META-INF directory and display the contents of MANIFEST.MF using more.
    * What do you see?

You should see the jar is generated to be run as a standalone application on your behalf:
    * Contains all the necessary runtime dependencies - BOOT-INF holds all your compiled classes and all the dependency jars
    * The manifest declares a main entry point (the Main-Class: property)

There are many ways to run this application, either directly using the JAR, using spring-boot:run goal from Maven or in your IDE as you did earlier.

Look over the Running Spring Boot Applications discussing various options for running a Spring Boot application.

For now run java -jar 32-jdbc-autoconfig-5.0.c.RELEASE.jar, you should get the same output as before.

### Create Custom Auto-configuration class - Optional
(Do this part of the lab only if you have extra time.)

In this part of the lab, you are going to build your own auto-configuration class.

The lab project is provided as 33-autoconfig-helloworld and it is NOT going to be imported into your IDE along with other projects.

This means you will have to import it separately from other projects.

* Import the 33-autoconfig-helloworld project
* Follow TODO steps

### Reviewing What we Did
We overrode Spring Boot's default behavior and defined a DataSource for ourselves. But which approach more appropriate?

Think about imperative declaration of DataSource auto- configuration disablement, versus disabling via configuration.

* If your use case is similar to wiring multiple data sources, it makes more sense to programmatically disable the auto- configuration given this is an fixed aspect of your design.

* If your design style favors non-functional concerns in configuration then Spring Boot external configuration is an available option.

### Summary
You should surmise by the end of the lab that Spring Boot can save you work:

* Simplified dependency management

* Simplified configuration

* Packaged Runtime

* Better test coverage with simple integration tests

Congratulations, you have completed the lab!
