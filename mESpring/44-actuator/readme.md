Spring Boot Actuators, Metrics and Health Indicators
---
### Purpose
In this lab you will gain experience with Spring Boot Actuator and its features.

### Learning Outcomes
You will learn how to:

Configure Spring Boot Actuator

Expose some or all Actuator endpoints

Define custom metrics

Extend the /actuator/health endpoint to add custom health checks

You will be using the 44-actuator project.

Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes.

### Use Case
All production applications should have health monitoring, and will often need metric gathering. Actuator gives us both of these. You will be enabling actuator in your project and implementing mechanisms to provide an additional custom metric to indicate the number of times Account details have been requested. Additionally, you will be creating a custom HealthIndicator and adding that to the overall health status that is obtained.

### Instructions
#### Enable Actuator
#### TODO-01 : Check dependencies

In the pom.xml or build.gradle for the actuator project, look for TODO-01. We have added the dependency on the Spring Boot Actuator starter.
#### TODO-02 : Review application

Run the application and using a browser that can display JSON (Firefox, Chrome), open http://localhost:8080/actuator/ and explore the links.

* If you prefer you can use curl or Postman to examine the links referred to in this lab.

Now visit the http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics endpoint.

You will see an error on this page. Even though there are many valid endpoints, only the info and health endpoints are automatically exposed in Actuator.

### Expose Actuator endpoints
#### TODO-03 Expose HTTP actuator endpoints.

In the application.properties file, expose the metrics and beans endpoints by setting the appropriate Spring Boot property.

* These are two of the many endpoints that can be exposed.

Once the application restarts, visit the /actuator/metrics endpoint again. Now you will see a list of all the metrics tracked by Actuator.

Try fetching the data for one of the metrics by constructing a url based on the name of the metric. For example, visit http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max.

View the beans our application has loaded by visiting http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans.

Revisit http://localhost:8080/actuator/info endpoint. You will now see that it no longer loads. This is because once the management.endpoints.web.exposure.include property has been set, the default accessible endpoints are no longer available.

#### TODO-04 Expose all HTTP actuator endpoints.

Modify the property again to expose all actuator endpoints. Once the application restarts, visit the following endpoints:

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans
- http://localhost:8080/actuator/health
- http://localhost:8080/actuator/info
- http://localhost:8080/actuator/mappings
- http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers
- http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/jvm.memory.max

Use tags with metrics endpoint

- http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests
- http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests?tag=method:GET
- http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests?tag=uri:/actuator/beans

Access some URL endpoints that are not existent and get metrics on them.

- http://localhost:8080/notexistent
- http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/http.server.requests?tag=status:404

### Change logging level
#### TODO-05 Change log level via ./actuator/loggers endpoint

Display logging level of account.web package

* http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers/accounts.web

Observe that the effectiveLevel is currently set to DEBUG
``` json
{
    "configuredLevel": null,
    "effectiveLevel": "DEBUG"
}
```
Add a log statement as shown below to the accountSummary() method of the controller
``` java
@GetMapping(value = "/accounts")
public @ResponseBody List<Account> accountSummary() {
   logger.debug("Logging message within accountSummary()"); // add this line
   return accountManager.getAllAccounts();
}
```
Once the application restarts, access /accounts url and verify that the log message gets displayed

Change the logging level to INFO using either curl or Httpie or Postman
``` console
curl -i -XPOST -H"Content-Type: application/json" localhost:8080/actuator/loggers/accounts.web -d'{"configuredLevel": "INFO"}'
``` 
``` console
http post localhost:8080/actuator/loggers/accounts.web configuredLevel=INFO
```
Verify that the effectiveLevel of the accounts.web package is now changed to INFO
``` json
{
    "configuredLevel": "INFO",
    "effectiveLevel": "INFO"
}
```
Access /accounts url again and verify that the log message no longer gets displayed

### Publish build information
Spring Boot Actuatorâ€™s info endpoint automatically publishes information about your application specified in the META-INF/build-info.properties file.

The META-INF/build-info.properties can be created by the Spring Boot Maven or Gradle Plugin during build

#### TODO-06 Add Maven goal or Gradle task

If you are using Maven, add build-info goal
``` xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>build-info</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```
if you are using Gradle, add BuildInfo task
``` json
springBoot  {
    buildInfo()
}
```
Rebuild the application preferably at the command line
``` console
./mvnw -pl 00-rewards-common -pl 01-rewards-db -pl 44-actuator clean install
```
``` console
./gradlew 44-actuator:clean 44-actuator:build
```
Verify that target/classes/META-INF/build-info.properties (for Maven) or build/resources/main/META-INF/build-info.properties (for Gradle) is created with build information

Visit info endpoint and verify that the build info gets displayed

#### TODO-07: Optional Add additional build properties

You can skip this step or do it after all the other TODO's are done.

If you are using Maven, add properties with appropriate values
``` xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>build-info</goal>
      </goals>
      <configuration>
        <additionalProperties>
           <name>actuator app</name>
           <javaVersion>1.8.0_144</javaVersion>
           <operatingSystem>Mac OS X (10.13.6)</operatingSystem>
        </additionalProperties>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```
If you are using Gradle, you can use system properties
``` java
springBoot  {
    buildInfo {
        properties {
            name = "actuator app"
            additional = [
                javaVersion:     System.properties['java.version'],
                operatingSystem: "${System.properties['os.name']} (${System.properties['os.version']})"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
Add the custom properties to the application.properties
``` xml
info.restaurant.location=New York
info.restaurant.discountPercentage=10
```
Rebuild the application

Visit info endpoint and verify that additional properties are displayed

### Define custom metrics - Counter
By default, Actuator exposes a number of useful but rather generic metrics. Often tracking metrics that are specific to your application's domain provides insights into operational, business, or other concerns.

Let's add a custom metric specific to our application that counts the number of times the account finder method is used.

#### TODO-08 : Add a counter with a tag

In the constructor of AccountController, add an instance of MeterRegistry as a second parameter.

Using the MeterRegistry, create a Counter called account.fetch with a tag of type/fromCode key/value pair by calling meterRegistry.counter("account.fetch", "type", "fromCode");.

Store the counter as a new data-member.

#### TODO-09 : Use the counter

In the accountDetails() method, call increment() on the Counter.
#### TODO-10 : Run the test

Verify that the tests in AccountControllerTests pass. Particularly the testHandleDetailsRequest(), which checks that the counter is working correctly.
#### TODO-11 : Verify the result

Once the application restarts, visit the (http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics endpoint again. You should now see account.fetch listed.

Visit the http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/account.fetch to view the data for your counter. This should display 0 since no accounts have been fetched yet.

Fetch an account by visiting http://localhost:8080/accounts/1.

Visit the (http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/account.fetch again, verify that the counter increase with each account fetch.

Try restarting your application. What happens to the counter?

### Define custom metrics - Timer
#### TODO-12 : Add timer using @Timed annotation

Add the following annotation to the accountSummary(..) method.
``` java
@Timed(value="account.timer", extraTags = {"source", "accountSummary"})
```
Add the following annotation to the accountDetails(..) method.
``` java
@Timed(value="account.timer", extraTags = {"source", "accountDetails"})
```
#### TODO-13 : Verify the result

Once the application restarts, visit the localhost:8080/accounts/1 and localhost:8080/accounts for a few times

Visit the (http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/account.timer and verify the timer metric

### Get detail health checks
#### TODO-14 : Add more details to the health check

Visit the /actuator/health endpoint.

By default there is very little info displayed at this endpoint.

In your application.properties file, enable more detailed health info by setting the management.endpoint.health.show-details to always.

Restart the application and refresh /actuator/health to see more health details.

### Create custom health checks
You can extend the default health checks so that your application reports whether it is down or up based on custom criteria or domain logic.

In this case, we will determine the health of the application based on whether there are any restaurants in the database. If there are no restaurants, then the health status of the application will be considered DOWN.

NOTE: Stop the ActuatorApplication to avoid it constantly restarting whilst we add new classes.

#### TODO-15a and TODO-15b : Setup a test

Navigate to the src/test/java directory. Inside the accounts.web package, there is a class called RestaurantHealthCheckTest. It is mostly written for you.

Modify the code to use the RestaurantHealthCheck.health() method in each test. The code will not compile yet - we have not written the code we are testing.

#### TODO-16a : Implement RestaurantHealthCheck

Navigate to the RestaurantHealthCheck class under the accounts.web package.

Modify the class to implements the HealthIndicator interface.

Implement the missing health() method with the following logic:
  * If there are one or more restaurants in the database, return Health.up().build().
  * Otherwise return Health.down().build().
  * You will need to pass the RestaurantRepository into this object via constructor injection.

#### TODO-16b : Test custom health indicator

Create an instance of RestaurantHealthCheck class in the setup method in the RestaurantHealthCheckTest

Remove @Disabled annotation from both tests

Run the tests and verify they pass.

#### TODO-17 : Access The Health Indicator

Restart the application.

Refresh the health endpoint. You should see that your application is DOWN because there are no Restaurants in the database.

#### TODO-18/19 : Repeat with restaurants in the database

To populate your database with a Restaurant, change the application.properties to set spring.datasource.data property with classpath:/data-with-restaurants.sql.

Once the server restarts refresh the health endpoint. You should now see that your application health reports UP.

Verify that all tests in the actuator project pass.

### Organize Health Indicators into groups
#### TODO-20 : Organize Health Indicators into groups

From Spring Boot 2.2, health indicators can be organized into groups using the format below.
``` 
management.endpoint.health.group.<group-name>.include=<list of health indicators>
```
Each group can be individually configured.

Create 3 groups: system, web, and application as following:
  * The system group includes diskSpace and db health indicators
  * The web group includes ping health indicator
  * The application group includes restaurantHealthCheck health indicator

For system and application groups, configure show-details with always

Remove management.endpoint.health.show-details=always since it is no longer needed

Restart the application and access the health endpoint per each group

  * http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/system
  * http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/web
  * http://localhost:8080/actuator/health/application
### Secure Actuator endpoints
#### TODO-21 : Add Spring Boot Security starter to the pom.xml or build.gradle file

#### TODO-22 : Add security configuration

The skeleton code of the security configuration class, ActuatorSecurityConfiguration is already provided. Uncomment the code until there is no compile errors.
#### TODO-23 : Add security configuration to ActuatorSecurityConfiguration class

Add code to provide access control to actuator endpoints
``` java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {

    http.authorizeRequests()
            .requestMatchers(EndpointRequest.to(HealthEndpoint.class, InfoEndpoint.class, PrometheusScrapeEndpoint.class)).permitAll()
            .requestMatchers(EndpointRequest.to(ConditionsReportEndpoint.class)).hasRole("ADMIN")
            .requestMatchers(EndpointRequest.toAnyEndpoint()).hasRole("ACTUATOR")
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
        .httpBasic()
            .and()
        .csrf().disable();
}
```
#### TODO-24 : Run the tests in the AccountClientSecurityTests

Take some time to understand what each test is for

Remove @Disabled annotation from each test and run it

Make sure all tests pass

### Summary
In this lab you have configured Spring Boot Actuator. You have also leveraged Spring Boot Actuator to give detailed information about application metrics and customized health stats.

Congratulations, you are done with the lab. If this were a production application, one logical next step would be to integrate Actuator with an external monitoring system.

### Optional exercises
Do the following exercises if you have an extra time.

#### TODO-25 (Optional) : Experiment with HealthIndicator

Change spring.datasource.data property in the application.properties file back to use data-no-restaurants.sql.

Include the restaurant count as extra detail in the health endpoint. Have a look at the Health class to see how this might work.

Instead of returning DOWN when there are no restaurants, use a custom status called NO_RESTAURANTS. You will have to create Status object.

When there are no restaurants in the DB, what top-level status is returned for the application health group?

Fix this issue by changing management.endpoint.health.group.application.status.order property in the "application.properties" file so that NO_RESTAURANTS gets displayed as top-level status for the application health group.

Restart the application and verify the result.

#### TODO-26 (Optional) : Use AOP for counting logic

If you are short on time, skip this step.

In general, mixing up different concerns (controller logic and counter logic in this example code) is not considered a good practice: it violates single responsibility principle. Instead, usage of AOP provides cleaner code.

Add spring-boot-starter-aop starter to the pom.xml or the build.gradle

Create an aspect, through which account.fetch counter, which has a tag of type/fromAspect key/value pair, gets incremented every time accountSummary method of the AccountController class is invoked

Access /accounts several times and verify the metrics of /actuator/metrics/account.fetch?tag=type:fromAspect

#### TODO-27 (Optional) : Access Actuator endpoints using JMX

If you are short on time, skip this step.

JMX is disabled by default from Spring Boot 2.2. Enable it by adding the following line to the application.properties file
```
spring.jmx.enabled=true
```
Restart the application

Open a terminal window and run jconsole. Accept the insecure connection if prompted

Starting JConsole

Figure 1: Starting JConsole

Select the MBeans tab, find the org.springframework.boot folder, then open the Endpoint sub-folder. Note that all actuator endpoints ARE exposed for JMX
