## DevOps

### What is DevOps?

Iris: "Develops is CI/CD!"

"Imagin a world where product owners, Development, QA, IT Operations and Infosec work together,
not only to help eash other, but also to ensure that the overall organization succeeds.
By working towards a common goal, they enable the fast flow of planned work into production,
while achieving world-class stability, reliability, availability and security."

"DevOps, in a sense, is about setting up a value delivery factory - 
a streamlined waste-free pipeline through which value can be delivered 
to the business with a predictably fast cycle time."
